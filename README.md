# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## The Project

For this project we had to create a random password generator that meets certain criteria so that the user
could create a strong password that provides greater security. The page was to include a button to click to 
generate a password. When the button is clicked the user is to be prompted for password criteria. When prompted
for the length the password must be at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters. When asked for character
types to be included in the password, the user needs to confirm if they want numbers, special characters, lowere case letters or uppercase letters. Once all the prompts are answered the input will be validated if atleast 1 character type if entered. Once the password is generated, it should be written on the page.


## Finished Product
